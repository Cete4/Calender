## Daily Calender
This project I worked at logging and dynamically updating a webpage while it isn't finished I plan on continuing to work on it.

## Motivation
This already exists in many forms but I wanted to make my own attempt.

## Build status
This build is still in progress with methods to be tweaked and features to be added.

## Code style
Not in a  specific code style. As I'm still learning and improving.
